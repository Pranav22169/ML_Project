Non-code elements in programming, such as comments, documentation, and whitespace, play a crucial role in improving code readability, maintainability, and collaboration. However, their inclusion tends to introduce overhead affecting code processing tools such as compilers and interpreters, as well as static analyzers. In essence, this study investigates the impact of non-code blocks on the performance metrics of time complexity, space complexity, and execution time. We take a regression model advance analysis to the proportion of non-code elements in Java code and their effect on the performance metrics. We quantify the impact with the aim of providing empirical insights into how that density of non-code affects the performance. Such findings aim at helping Java developers make decisions regarding the code structuring and documentation while balancing well on aspects relating to maintainability and efficiency.
